# fasTools
Tools to work with fastx files. There's many, many better implementations, this is just my shot at it. (I wanted to make a python project before moving on to Rust).

Inspired by [SeqKit](https://github.com/shenwei356/seqkit)


## Test files
The fasta test files are from [Rosalind](rosalind.info). <br>
